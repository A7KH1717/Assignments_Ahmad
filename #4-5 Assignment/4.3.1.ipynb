The entities are tagged with labels that classify what type of entity they are (e.g., DATE, PERSON, ORG(=organization), GPE(=Geopolitical Entity)). These named entities can be considered PII, as they might be used to identify an individual either directly or when combined with other additional information. In conclusion, when there is a non-empty list in the 'PII' column in a specific row, we have to apply some sort of anonymisation mechanism to prevent the PIIs from being able to identify an individual."
